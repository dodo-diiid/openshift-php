## About:

The "Property Proxy" extension provides a fairly transparent proxy for internal object properties hidden in custom non-zval implementations.

> **Note:** This extension mostly only provides infrastructure for other extensions.

See the php\PropertyProxy class, for the user-land visible part of the implementation.
